        <section>Dr. Jared Bates would like to allow students to explore the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma. The
            game would consist of playing an indeterminate number of rounds against a computer opponent
            who has implemented a strategy against the player. Each round, the player is given two choices:
            cooperate or defect. Some strategies are more effective than others, and after playing against an
            opponent the player is provided information about the chosen strategy. As the player continues
            through the game, they are introduced to more strategies (with varying degrees of
            sophistication). This game is meant to provide experiential learning as opposed to a laid out
            lesson, and the player should be encouraged to experiment with their own strategies to score the
            most points possible.
